# object-detection-test
Playing around with OpenCV, followed tutorial from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/11/object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-opencv/

Planning on creating my own Pytorch model and loading it instead of the default, and trying to use live video instead of images in the future.
